### Hi there 👋
## About Me 🚀
My name is Charles Hall & I am a Software Engineer at Dell Technologies. I have been programming ever since high school after I saw my younger brother creating awesome games in Unity. This inspired me to take AP Computer Science, the only class offered at my high school at the time, and clearly I enjoyed it enough to pursue my career! 

I graduated from UGA (go Dawgs!!) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science in December of 2020. I joined a company called Talent Path, where I was able to further my knowledge of API's & Full Stack application development. This knowledge helped me get a position as a contractor at Dell, which later turned into an opporutunity to join as a full-time employee!

### Fun Facts
- I love to play video games (very unique hobby). 🖱️
- I enjoy reading self-improvement & personal finance books. 📕
